# VRP-GeneticAlgorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm. The VRP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem where a fleet of vehicles must serve a set of customers, each with a given demand, while minimizing the total distance traveled.
## Introduction
The VRP-GeneticAlgorithm project aims to solve the VRP using a genetic algorithm approach. The genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It starts with an initial population of candidate solutions and applies genetic operators such as mutation and crossover to produce new generations of better solutions.
## Features
- Solve VRP instances with various problem sizes and complexities.
- Optimize vehicle routes to minimize the total distance traveled.
- Support for multiple depots and multiple vehicles.
- Genetic algorithm implementation with customizable parameters.
